All here is technical :)

Hi All,

Mostly Java Applications developed using new technologies would be placed over here by me time to time.

I am placing "Example of Spring ActiveMQ to send Email" that shows 
how to place a java object in ActiveMQ and later retrieve it and send mail using it.

Thanks
Shailendra
